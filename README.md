This project has two classes, one is the LinkedList and the other is the Stack. The LinkedList is a single linked list that has all required functions and the Stack is a vector based stack with all the required functions as well. The main file shows off all the functions for both of these classes in two parts, part 1 is the linked list and part 2 is the stack. I have included screenshots of the console that the main file produces and I've seperated them into those two parts.
